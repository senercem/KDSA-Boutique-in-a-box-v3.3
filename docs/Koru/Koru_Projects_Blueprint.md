# **3.0 Koru Impact \- Projects, Initiatives, and Investment Blueprints**

This blueprint synthesizes the strategic, technical, and commercial mandates for Koru Impact's core projects, R\&D initiatives, and major external proposals. It translates the firm's architecture into market-facing capabilities and investment theses.Part I: The Koru Decision-Science Architecture (KDSA) Program

The KDSA is the flagship, board-visible strategic initiative to build a market-defining capability that acts as a "System 2" solution to the **Corrected Triad of Decision Risk** in the Financial Services (FS) sector.

1. **Strategic Rationale (KDSA Playbook v3.3):**  
   * **Core Objective:** To address the systemic failure of organizations to make effective decisions and execute strategic change by solving the interconnected triad of Human-Factor Risk, Cognitive-Bias Risk, and Algorithmic & AI Risk.  
   * **The "Whole Solution":** To sense the human factor (M1), de-bias the human decision (M2), and govern the algorithmic output (M3) in one loop, creating the "KDSA Gold Standard."  
   * **Architecture:** Framed as a **Component-as-a-Service (CaaS)** and a **"Boutique-in-a-Box"** designed for integration.  
   * **GTM Strategy:** The sole GTM doctrine is the **Partner-to-Incumbent (P2I)** model, where partners consume KDSA capabilities via headless REST endpoints. The direct-to-client model is formally falsified for the FS beachhead.  
   * **Development Status:** A **45-day MVP Sprint** (kicked off November 2025\) was approved for the three-module service design, targeting an end-of-year market entry.  
2. **The Three Modular Services:**

| Module | Name / Internal Title | Strategic Role & Function |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **M1** | ACORE Module | **Adaptive Capacity Organizational Regulation Engine.** Ingests human-factor risks (change fatigue, low psychological safety) and is the **"Decoupler Product"** designed for the 'land' phase of the GTM strategy. Owned by Dilek Yurdabak. |
| **M2** | Decision Engine | **System Two Antidote.** Triggers a deliberate, cognitive de-biasing workflow for human decision-makers when risks are high, promoting analytical reasoning over intuitive "System 1" shortcuts. Owned by Şener Cem Irmak. |
| **M3** | Project Alexandra | **AI Risk & Compliance Engine.** Creates an immutable, auditable log of the entire decision process, serving as the **Governance Layer** to ensure compliance and mitigate escalating regulatory risk (e.g., NIST, EU AI Act). Owned by Alexandra Binyamin. |

Part II: The AI Insight Engine Investment Thesis

This R\&D initiative positions the firm to solve the market's **"GenAI Divide,"** where 95% of corporate AI initiatives fail to deliver measurable ROI.

1. **The Problem:** Current AI tools are a-contextual, brittle, and lack the capacity to learn from feedback or retain organizational context, stalling impact at individual productivity rather than systemic transformation.  
2. **Koru's Solution (AI Insight Engine v3.0):** An **"Interactive Cathedral"** and **"hypothesis-generation and validation platform."**  
   * **Function:** Engineered to analyze complex, qualitative, and multimodal corporate data (e.g., interview transcripts, strategic documents) to generate defensible, systemic insights into the hidden drivers of organizational performance.  
   * **Inimitable Advantage:** Positioned as a new, superior **Operating System for Value Creation**, moving beyond simple retrieval to create a Digital Twin of an Organization through a hybrid cognitive-behavioral architecture.

Part III: Operation Green Horizon (GCF Proposal)

This project is a high-stakes proposal to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) Office of the Internal Auditor (OIA).

1. **Assignment:** Advisory Services on Change Management (RFP/RFx202500063).  
2. **Koru's Strategic Reframing:** The standard consultancy domain of "Change Management" is elevated to **Forensic Behavioral Assurance** and **Internal Control Validation**, explicitly invoking IIA Standard 2310, to defend a premium pricing strategy.  
3. **Scope & Constraints:**  
   * **Level of Effort:** Expected to require approximately **60–65 working days** total effort, regardless of the number of personnel proposed. The estimated budget will not be disclosed by GCF.  
   * **Financial Strategy:** Applied a **"Compressed Equity"** rate structure to lower the ceiling for Managing Director and Team Leader rates and raise the floor for Analyst and Operational roles, promoting team cohesion. Faruk Sevinç is formalized as the Agile Delivery Lead for an 8-week "Sprint Block."  
4. **Submission Requirements:** The **Technical Proposal MUST NOT contain any pricing information** to avoid disqualification, and a separate Financial Proposal is required. Submission is conditional on full compliance with formal requirements and acceptance of the GCF Model contract.

Part IV: Project Lighthouse

This research-validated initiative is a crucial component of Koru Impact’s strategy to address the critical inflection point of workplace mental health.

1. **Strategic Imperative:** To validate a new, high-value market category and serve as definitive proof-of-concept for long-term partnerships (e.g., the pilot with Psychotherapy.net).  
2. **Goal:** To move beyond traditional corporate wellness programs by establishing a state-of-the-art research partnership to generate irrefutable, client-specific data.  
3. **Market Validation:** The project is justified by data showing 76% of U.S. workers report a mental health symptom, and 84% report that their workplace contributes to the challenge, costing the global economy $1 trillion annually in lost productivity.  
4. **GTM Strategy (Pilot):** The commercial logic is rooted in a proven **"land-and-expand" B2B strategy**, where the pilot's success de-risks and scientifically justifies a subsequent, larger-scale "Lighthouse Program" engagement.
